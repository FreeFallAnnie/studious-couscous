      <h2>Tinkerer</h2>
      <p>Tinkerer is a mindset I made-up that can underpin any hands-on activity. The skill of tinkering, is about playing, experimenting, and working to get better by incrementally exploring – following my learning scale, it’s trying something others have done, mimic them, change it up, then see if you can work towards independence, and sharing what I’ve learnt.</p>

      <h2>3D Printing (A)</h2>
      <p>Throughout this term so far I have been exposed to many opportunities and encouraged to grow by cohort members and tutors. I have not progressed as far as I would have liked with 3D printing. While I was able to create my own 3D model, I needed assistance to make it viable.</p>

      <h2>Programming (B)</h2>
      <p>My programming skills have been developing throughout the term. However, I am not fully comfortable creating my own programs. I use prompts, and assistance to code. In my Demo Day process, I included comments on the good, and bad of coding. Below are images from my journey that I am proud of.</p>

      <h2>Laser cutting (C)</h2>
      <p>I began laser cutting in the workshop run by the Maker’s Space. This was a light introduction, which gave a sense of familiarity for the tools involved. Though this was not enough to have me feeling confident, I found I was curious about exploring.</p>
      <p>When I went to create my ‘Brain Box’ I set a task that was a low entry point. A templated box which helped me build confidence in the programs to use. I utilised that knowledge to then etch my own design.</p>
      <p>Though my knowledge is limited, when Vaswati needed help with her design, I was able to assist.</p>
