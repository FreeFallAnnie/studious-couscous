      <h2>Show Me (the Data)</h2>
      <p>Show Me (the Data) is about data and presentation. The subskills include data visualisation, modelling and simulation with agent-based modelling, including python and NetLogo, along with the addition of storytelling with data.</p>

      <h2>Data Visualisation (A)</h2>
      <p>The data visualisation skill did not eventuate in the way I foresaw. While I envisioned digital data display, a conversation with Tritian led to physical collection of data, and display, with colour-coded responses. I was happy with the way the data was shown; however, I would also like to explore further visualisation tools and create digital displays.</p>

      <h2>Agent-Based Modelling (B)</h2>
      <p>I have been doing the agent-based modelling course, offered by the Santa Fe Institute on their learning platform - Complexity Explorer. Along with researching agent-based modelling as a methodology, and having conversations with others, including Sungyeon.</p>

      <h2>Data Storytelling (C)</h2>
      <p>I have adapted Show Me (the Data) to include the story of the data as a way of creating process - the idea came during fortnight 5. I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to express data stories however; I look forward to further developing this aspect for Checkpoint 3.</p>
