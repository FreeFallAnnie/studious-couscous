      <h2>Skill Description</h2>
      <p><strong>A Little Fuzzy</strong> is science communication, with openness to ambiguity and an iterative, exploratory process. I’ve developed this by appearing on the Fuzzy Logic Radio station as a cohost—researching, preparing and delivering content on scientific topics, and interviewing scientists during Pint of Science.</p>

      <h2>Subskills & Self-Assessment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A: Research</li>
        <li>B: Voice Presence</li>
        <li>C: Conversational Skills</li>
        <li>D: Sharing Publicly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Checkpoint 1 to 2 growth is shown in a custom matrix (see reflective narrative below).</p>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <h3>Research (A)</h3>
      <p>I learned to quickly extract useful insights from scientific papers and convert them into engaging questions for the show. This marks a big shift from occasional curiosity to deliberate, applied research.</p>

      <h3>Voice Presence (B)</h3>
      <p>While I started at level 3 due to experience in Toastmasters and voice work, I haven't yet moved to creating my own content. Future work will focus on confidently taking ownership of scripting and delivery.</p>

      <h3>Conversational Skills (C)</h3>
      <p>Through radio and science events, I've expanded beyond casual talk into purposeful dialogue—one highlight being a thoughtful email of appreciation from interviewee Tirath.</p>

      <h3>Sharing Publicly (D)</h3>
      <p>I still rely on external cues (e.g. Fuzzy Logic or assessment prompts) to publish work. My goal is to independently publish a project by Checkpoint 3.</p>

      <h2>Checkpoint Growth</h2>
      <p>Skill growth from Checkpoint 1 to 2 is visualized in both narrative and matrix formats. Notable areas of improvement include confidence in live discussions, and ability to independently research science topics for a general audience.</p>
